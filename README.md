<h2>Data_Analysis_Project_1</h2>
<p>This repository contains links to dashboards that provide visualizations and analyses of COVID-19 data specific to New York State and the broader United States. The dashboards cover topics such as vaccination rates among healthcare workers, the disparity in infection and hospitalization rates across different regions, and patterns of internet usage changes due to the pandemic. Each hypothesis addresses a unique aspect of the COVID-19 impact:</p>

<h3>Hypothesis 1:</h3>
<p><b>Vaccination Among Healthcare Workers in New York State (2022):</b> Vaccination rates among healthcare workers reached a peak of 65% fully vaccinated and 55% with boosters in the second quarter, then declined by 5% in the third quarter as COVID-19 cases decreased.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis 2:</h3>
<p><b>COVID-19 Case Rates by Age and Region (March 2020 - February 2022):</b> The 20-44 age group in metropolitan counties of New York State saw about 30% more COVID-19 cases compared to non-metropolitan counties, likely due to higher workplace exposure.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis 3:</h3>
<p><b>Vaccination Rates in Metropolitan vs. Non-metropolitan Counties (January 2021 - December 2023):</b> Metropolitan counties in New York were 45% more vaccinated, likely because these counties have more hospitals.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis 4:</h3>
<p><b>Hospitalization Rates in New York (October 2021 - July 2023):</b> New York County had a COVID hospitalization rate of 0.5% of its total population, compared to 0.3% in non-metropolitan counties.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis 5:</h3>
<p><b>Internet Usage During the Pandemic (2020):</b> The United States experienced a more than 25% increase in daily internet communication during the pandemic, driven by a shift towards remote work.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis 6:</h3>
<p><b>Gender-Specific COVID-19 Symptoms in the US (May 2020):</b> Over 60% of females were likely to experience fever as a symptom of COVID-19 compared to males, potentially due to greater exposure during shopping and grocery trips.</p>
